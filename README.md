# Generative Adversarial Network using PyTorch
In this project, we implement a basic GAN model using PyTorch to generate handwritten digits.
To learn more about GANs, check a mathematical tutorial in my github.

## File Structure
mnist.ipynb ----- A comprehensive notebook, step-by-step explanation of model bulidng 
mnist.py ----- A fast-run version, script that you can see results within approximate hour after training
utils.py ----- Print resuls, save model and related



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone this Github repo into your local machine.

2. You will need to have the following packages install: torchvision, tensorboardx, jupyter, matplotlib, numpy

3. Open the iPython Notebook mnist.ipynb and follow the tutorial inside.
